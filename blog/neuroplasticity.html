        <p class="article">
          Neuroplasticity is the brain‚Äôs capacity to continue growing and evolving in response to life experiences. Plasticity is the capacity to be shaped, molded, or altered; neuroplasticity, then, is the ability for the brain to adapt or change over time, by creating new neurons and building new networks.

        <p class="article">I haven‚Äôt done much about mental practice. I learned that mental practice leads me to great results as physical practice. I was surprised at how imagination is important to achieve a goal.

        <p class="article">
          A growth mindset means that you thrive on challenge, and don't see failure as a way to describe yourself but as a springboard for growth and developing your abilities.

          I just thought about the education system in Japan. My result of numbers (exam or sport competition ) has always affected me in a good way and a bad way. 
          I believed  the result is alway important than the process since when I was a kid. So now I am struggling to keep being confident and admire myself during the process without any results.
          I will practice to grow my mindset better, like complimenting myself often.

        <p class="article">
          I believe I can make my achievement! However, through my courses I realize that it is hard to keep my positive attitude towards study.
          After the core study I just thought again that being positive and having a confident attitude will make my performance better and better. 
          All the research and the studies gave me motivation and I decided again I  will keep going with my positive attitude and never avoid conflicts and challenges. I would like to tell myself ‚Äúyou are doing a great job everyday!! If you don‚Äôt understanding something,0 you don‚Äôt understand YET ‚Äù

        <p class="article">From some research I am glad to know that ‚ÄùThe brain changes most rapidly in childhood, but it‚Äôs now clear that the brain continues to develop throughout life.‚Äù 
          I thought I should force myself to learn more technical skills than core skills but I learned the core skill is also important to develop my technical skills. I will try to improve both tech and core.
