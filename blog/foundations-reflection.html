          What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego
          due to the core learning?

        <p class="article">
          I don't compliment myself much. → How to improve → I made my new
          habit. Before going to sleep I tell myself “You did a great job!”
          everyday. I don't have much confidence in myself. → I expect my new
          habit will allow me to make myself more confident. I want to always be
          perfect. → I am telling myself not to rush the time that will come to
          you in the future!

          What are the roles of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning
          and programming?
        </h3>
        <p class="article">
          I think awere yourself is important to help to corroborate with
          people. That leads your work environment better and results better.

          One of my favorite quotes “Fake it to you make it ” is proven

          What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?

          Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time
          focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?
        </h3>
        <p class="article">
          I just realized that core skills are much as important as tech skills
          for my past work experience and this study. Might core skills are more
          important than tech one.

          Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste
          of time?
        </h3>
        <p class="article">
          I think it is important to study. I know and am more aware of myself
          and I can improve my soft skills.

          Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead?
          Justify your answer.
        </h3>
        <p class="article">
          I like to improve both my core skills and tech skills.
