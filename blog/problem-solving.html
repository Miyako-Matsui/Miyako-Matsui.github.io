        <h3 class="title">Blocked by a simple problem.</h3>

        <p class="article">
          I realized that whether there is a space or not ( for example (‚Äú‚Äù) and
          (‚Äú ‚Äú) ) is a huge difference in Javascript. I sometimes make typos and
          it leads to some problems with my code. I have to be more careful of
          small mistakes

        <p class="article">
          I have done the "Variables and objects" and the "Manipulating Objects"
          from Kata earlier than the timebox. Else‚Ä¶‚Ä¶. <br />JS is still hard for
          me! I can‚Äôt say I am having fun through the sprint 4. I hope I can
          enjoy and solve issues in the near future‚Ä¶.ü•π

        <h4 class="small-title">Pseudocode</h4>
        <p>
          Pseudocode helps me with a strategy of how to code and make my ideas
          clear. I just started it in the late stages, so I should try it more
          often for further challenges.
          <br />‚óØ

        <h4 class="small-title">Trying something</h4>
        <p>
          I am using this method most of the time unfortunately it doesn‚Äôt go
          well most of time (üò≠)
          <br />
          ‚óé(however results ‚ñ≥)
        </p>

        <h4 class="small-title">Rubber ducky method</h4>
        <p>
          I used this method especially for the loop which I am still confused
          about how to use. I don‚Äôt use this method much at the moment.
          <br />‚ñ≥
        </p>

        <h4 class="small-title">Reading error messages</h4>
        <p>
          I fixed some issues by using this method. However, I'm not very
          confident about reading them.
          <br />‚óØ
        </p>

        <h4 class="small-title">Console.logging</h4>
        <p>
          When I am not confident in what I code I use this method. It helps me
          because it shows the result immediately and I am able to know where
          the issue is in my code. However I am still struggling to use the
          console.log I will practice more.
          <br />‚óØ
        </p>

        <h4 class="small-title">Googling</h4>
        <p>
          When I face the issue I always google, but I sometimes can not find
          what I want to know. I also searched on Youtube.

        <h4 class="small-title">Asking your peers for help</h4>
        <p>
          I have not asked my peers much but I am sure they are always willing
          to help others!
          <br />‚ñ≥
        </p>

        <h4 class="small-title">Asking coaches for help</h4>
        <p>
          My partner is my coach / mentor so far. I ask him for advice /
          feedback on my code quite often.
          <br />‚óé
        </p>

        <h4 class="small-title">Improving your process with reflection</h4>
        <p>
          I usually look back to what I did the week or last week. That
          sometimes helps me with new ideas of code. Reflection is really useful
          for better understanding. I will practice using LeetCode this weekend.
