      <h1>Identity, Values, and Strengths Exploration</h1>
      <br />
      <div class="content">
        <h3 class="title">
          Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss
          how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision
          you made, and how you reflect on the decision now.
        </h3>

          My biggest decision when I decided to live in NZ 3 years ago. I was
          borned and grew up in Japan. In Japan there is not much mixed culture,
          values and identities. They believe people doing the same thing are
          the greatest, too self-conscious and your work is the best priority.
          They do not like anything unique. I always felt not free and could not
          be myself. Since I came to NZ people like unique and so many values.
          People do what they like and their best priority is always their
          family. I love myself more than when I was in Japan. It is very
          fortunate I met a great partner and friends who are always by my side
          in NZ. Besides, I found my new goal influenced by them.

          Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced
          your values and identity.

        <p class="article">
          Since I came to NZ I have met a lot of people from a variety of
          nationalities. It is not easy at all living in a different culture but
          it shows me a new world (in a good way and a bad way…haha). It’s fun
          for me. I love that people think you can start or learn something new
          at any age in NZ. In Japan not many people try something new
          especially if you are over 30 years old. I was influenced by NZ
          culture and I am challenging my new study at Dev Academy! I am 30
          years old and I want to prove to people in Japan that you can
          challenge and succeed in a different country even if you are 30 years
          old!

          I have very strong motivation to achieve my goals. I never give up
          what I want to or what I want to be. Just keep going for the archive
          with a positive mind like I can do that!!! I am sure my strengths help
          me in my new journey in the IT industry.

        <p class="article">
          I have been worrying about a language barrier. I may need more time to
          understand what people are talking or explaining to me than other
          people. However I have kept improving myself and my language skills. I
          am taking note when I find an unknown word and when I am not sure
          something I always confirm that my understanding is correct.

          Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with
          others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you
          tried at the time, how effective they were, and your reflections on
          what other strategies you would try now and why.

          I tend to try to make a good environment at work.This good environment
          means communicating with colleagues and trying to know their
          personality and try to show my personality too. I believe it will lead
          us to a great collaborative relationship. Once I met a difficult
          colleague. He was a bit stubborn with his opinions and did not listen
          to others' opinions.I tried to talk to him and found our common hobby.
          When we faced an issue he tended to listen to me more and we found a
          compromise to solve the issue.
