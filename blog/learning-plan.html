          I would like to start my career as a software developer or software
          tester for a fully remote job. After gaining experience and knowledge
          I am interested in training people like Dev academy is doing for me.
          My biggest dream is to start my business in the future!I don’t have
          any concrete plans yet but I would like to do something related to IT,
          Japan and NZ.

        <p class="article">
          I am highly motivated to achieve my goals. I also give my positive
          energy to my team. However I found that it was difficult to keep my
          motivation and positive attitude during the fondation due to lack of
          knowledge and experience. That is my limitation. When something
          happens, I panic because I don’t know how I should start first due to
          not having enough knowledge. I learned during foundation that the best
          way for me when I face difficulty is I should calm myself and talk
          with someone or a bit away from my computer and think about what I am
          able to do first and I start with what I can do.

        <p class="article">
          My biggest concern is that I can keep up in the Bootcamp course
          because of the language barrier. I will try to ask questions when I am
          not clear or I share my opinions.

        <p class="article">
          I think how productively and efficiently working in a group is really
          important during Bootcamp and of course after starting my career in
          the IT industry. I would like to be trained to improve collaboration
          skills and how to work individually as a team member.

          I think career change is a huge transition so I would like to get
          advice based on facilitators experience beyond technical issues.
          Studying at Deve Academy is a great opportunity for me. I never give
          up my new challenge and I would like to get support for success in
          this opportunity.

          I would like to separate my focus time and time with a team or
          facilitator. I like to work in the morning so I would like to use my
          time in the morning. After lunch is open to my team and facilitator. I
          also respect other people’s time so when I need to do something with
          them I look at timing and talk to them.

        <p class="article">
          I am still learning and finding that I really want or like Tech. I was
          more interested in the work environment than the actual work in the IT
          industry before I started at Dev Academy. I was thinking of being a
          software tester. The reason was being a tester not an essential IT
          degree or IT background apparently. However I am here at Dec Academy
          gladly! During this course I am enjoying coding and I am motivated to
          learn and improve my current skills more and more. I am interested in
          being a software developer now. In terms of my goal, firstly I would
          like to start my tech career as a developer or tester and I am keen to
          support someone who wants to be a developer after I gain enough
          experience in the IT industry. My biggest goal is to start my IT
          business. ( there are no plans yet….:P)

          A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to
          learning.
        </h3>
        <p class="article">
          My strengths are I am highly motivated to achieve my goal and do not
          give up easily. Another strength is that I am open minded. I have
          gained this strength from my past work experience. I found that
          listening to others’ opinions and sharing my opinion is really
          important and it leads to great performance as a team and improved
          individual skills. My limitation is in situations where I worked under
          pressure. I tend to focus on things to be done quickly. This has made
          me appear to make easy mistakes. As a result, I have learned to be
          aware of this fact. I tried to calm myself and prioritize my task.
          This has resulted in reducing mistakes and performing better quality
          tasks.

        <p class="article">
          I would like to develop my collaboration skills. I have developed my
          teamwork skills in the hospitality industry but IT is new for me. It
          might be a different way to ask help to other college/ team members
          from my experience. I also would like to develop my problem solving
          skills. Everything is new so far so I still panic when some problems
          happen unexpectedly.

        <p class="article">
          I make a whole week's plan every Monday and follow the plan. When I
          can’t commit to it I make time the next day. For example, I wake up
          2~3hours earlier than usual. I try to follow my original plan. When
          there are a lot of tasks first I make a summary in bullet points and
          prioritize the tasks. I always say to myself “ A journey of a thousand
          miles starts with one step” to calm myself. If there is a big issue, I
          break the problem into small pieces like a puzzle.I am always willing
          to help other people and want to respect them. To the facilitator I
          answer their request as soon as possible and follow their steps as
          much as I can. Because it's all for me. I want to develop myself and
          my skills during this great opportunity.

          I am taking notes and bookmarks when I find useful information. I will
          check these first. If I could not solve the issue yet in this case I
          will google or search on Youtube to find the solution. To ask someone
          is my last choice. The reason is I would like to avoid interrupting
          someone’s time. Another reason is I don’t know when I can get their
          response/answer. I want to save my time as well.

          I am currently working for a company for 1 or 2 hours on weekdays.
          Sometimes on weekends. I told them in June that I would like to resign
          in September. However, unfortunately there are some things that
          overlap like traning my replacement, my boss’s maternity leave and
          also we are a small company so very limited to take over my position.
          For these reasons I am still working for the company. I am going to
          resign in October. I emphasize to them that my priority is Dev Academy
          and I am going to be really busy with study in October.
