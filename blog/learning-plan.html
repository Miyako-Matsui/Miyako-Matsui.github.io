            <h3 class="title">What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h3>
            <p class="article">I am still learning and finding that I really want or like Tech.
              I was more interested in the work environment than the actual work in the IT industry before I started at Dev Academy. I was thinking of being a software tester. The reason was being a tester not an essential IT degree or IT background apparently.  
              However I am here at Dec Academy gladly! During this course I am enjoying coding and I am motivated to learn and improve my current skills more and more.
              I am interested in being a software developer now. 
              In terms of my goal, firstly I would like to start my tech career as a developer or tester and I am keen to support someone who wants to be a developer after I gain enough experience in the IT industry.
              My biggest goal is to start my IT business. ( there are no plans yet….:P)</p>

            <h3 class="title">A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning.
            </h3>
            <p class="article">My strengths are I am highly motivated to achieve my goal and do not give up easily. 
              Another strength is that I am open minded. I have gained this strength from my past work experience. I found that listening to others’ opinions and sharing my opinion is really important and it leads to great performance as a team and improved individual skills.
              My limitation is in situations where I worked under pressure. I tend to focus on things to be done quickly. This has made me appear to make easy mistakes. As a result, I have learned to be aware of this fact. I tried to calm myself and prioritize my task. This has resulted in reducing mistakes and performing better quality tasks.</p>

          <div class="content">
            <h3 class="title">What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h3>
            <p class="article">I would like to develop my collaboration skills. I have developed my teamwork skills in the hospitality industry but IT is new for me. It might be a different way to ask help to other college/ team members from my experience.
              I also would like to develop my problem solving skills. Everything is new so far so I still panic when some problems happen unexpectedly.

          <div class="content">
            <h3 class="title">A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme.</h3>
            <p class="article">I make a whole week's plan every Monday and follow the plan. When I can’t commit to it I make time the next day. For example, I wake up 2~3hours earlier than usual. I try to follow my original plan.
              When there are a lot of tasks first I make a summary in bullet points and prioritize the tasks. I always say to myself “ A journey of a thousand miles starts with one step” to calm myself.
               If there is a big issue, I break the problem into small pieces like a puzzle.I am always willing to help other people and want to respect them. To the facilitator I answer their request as soon as possible and follow their steps as much as I can. Because it's all for me. I want to develop myself and my skills during this great opportunity.</p>

          <div class="content">
            <h3 class="title">A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</h3>
            <p class="article">I am taking notes and bookmarks when I find useful information. I will check these 
              first. If I could not solve the issue yet in this case I will google or search on Youtube to find the solution. To ask someone is my last choice. The reason is I would like to avoid interrupting someone’s time. Another reason is I don’t know when I can get their response/answer. I want to save my time as well. </p>

            <h3 class="title">A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</h3>
            <p class="article">I would like to hear any feedback and want to improve myself.
              It might be great to talk from the facilitator one to one if I face an issue or concern during the bootcamp.</p>

            <h3 class="title">Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things</h3>
            <p class="article">I am currently working for a company for 1 or 2 hours on weekdays. Sometimes on weekends. 
              I told them in June that I would like to resign in September.
              However, unfortunately there are some things that overlap like traning my replacement, my boss’s maternity leave and also we are a small company so very limited to take over my position. For these reasons I am still working for the company. 
              I am going to resign in October. I emphasize to them that my priority is Dev Academy and I am going to be really busy with study in October.
