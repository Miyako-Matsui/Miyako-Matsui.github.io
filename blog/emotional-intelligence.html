        <h3 class="title">What is Emotional Intelligence?</h3>
        <p class="article">
          Emotional intelligence (otherwise known as emotional quotient or EQ)
          is the ability to understand, use, and manage your own emotions in
          positive ways to relieve stress, communicate effectively, empathize
          with others, overcome challenges and defuse conflict.

        <p class="article">
          IQ tests measure your ability to solve problems, use logic, and grasp
          or communicate complex ideas. EQ tests measure your ability to
          recognize emotion in yourself and others, and to use that awareness to
          guide your decisions.

        <h3 class="title">Why is it important?</h3>
        <p class="article">
          Emotional Intelligence improves your assertiveness by allowing you to
          communicate effectively. By being aware of your emotions, and by
          having self-control, you can communicate your thoughts clearly and
          with confidence. In turn, this will make you more assertive and
          confident, without coming across as pushy or aggressive. By becoming
          more assertive, you can put forward your ideas and your experience
          effectively, instead of being passive and letting others take the
          lead. This is beneficial as your colleagues wonâ€™t always know what
          your skills and expertise are unless you communicate them and put them
          forward.
